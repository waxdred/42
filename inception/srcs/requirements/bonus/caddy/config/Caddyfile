# The Caddyfile is an easy way to configure your Caddy web server.
#
# Unless the file starts with a global options block, the first
# uncommented line is always the address of your site.
#
# To use your own domain name (with automatic HTTPS), first make
# sure your domain's A/AAAA DNS records are properly pointed to
# this machine's public IP, then replace ":80" below with your
# domain name.

#       root * /usr/share/caddy

#       # Enable the static file server.
#       file_server
#
#       # Another common task is to set up a reverse proxy:
#       # reverse_proxy localhost:8080
#
#       # Or serve a PHP site through php-fpm:
#       # php_fastcgi localhost:9000
#}
